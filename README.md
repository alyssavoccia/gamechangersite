# gamechangersite
This is a website that I developed for Limestone College for the GameChanger program that they started with NCPH to help student athletes with mental health issues and ensuring that they have the help they need. This project was made with a mobile-first approach and has breakpoints for tablets and desktops. As I continue to learn new skills this is a project that I would like to come back to, to improve and practice new skills.
